    "Extracting the radiomic feature will be done by employing the standard open-source Python package developed for radiomic features in medical imaging known as __[PyRadiomics](https://pyradiomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)__. <br><br>\n",
    "The __[Kaggle Data Science Bowl 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017)__ contains a total number of 2101 clinical chest Low-Dose Computed Tomography scans from which 1397, 198, and 506 subjects belong to the training, validation, and test sets, respectively.<br> The goal of the challenge was to automatically predict lung cancer status; for that, each image was labeled as “1” if the patient was diagnosed with lung cancer within one year from the scan and “0” otherwise. Therefore, the idea was to develope a model to predict the binary cancer status.<br> The challenge organizer provided .dcm image data and a .csv file with the corresponding cancer status but not the segmentation masks or coordinates of the lung nodules. <br> From 1397 training subjects, 968 LDCT scans were manually examined by an expert radiologist and 1297 pulmonary nodules were delineated.<br>\n",
    "Therefore, we want to load the original LDCT scans along with their corresponding segmentation masks to extract the radiomic features.<br><br>\n",
    "The following figure shows the 2D axial views of four cases. The first row represents the benign lung nodules while the second rows demonstrates the malignant nodule. As it can be seen from the examples, visually distinguishing these two classes from each other is a demanding task as they shared numerous visual characteristics."
